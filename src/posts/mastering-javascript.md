JavaScript powers the web - it's the <bold>most</bold> important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

``` js

const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

const printBasics = () => {
  console.log(basics);
}

printBasics()

```

Do you know difference between it?

``` js

const basics = 'Okay, that can be tricky!';

(function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
})()

```
